```

This shows you available datasets you could use
```{r}

```

## Data Types
```{r}
# use class() to determine data type
class(a) 
class(ls)
```
```{r}
#installing packages
install.packages("dslabs")
```

```{r}
#loading a library
library(dslabs)
data("murders")
class(murders) #check if is a data frame
```
```{r}
str(murders) # str() shows structure of dataset
```
## Working with Data Sets
```{r}
# $ allows you to access parts of a data frame
murders$population
```
